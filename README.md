# Si

Don't worry! This project has nothing to do with actual Silicon...

## What is this?

This is a programming language. Name is a pun of C.

In the past, my projects were either purely translated, interpreted, or compiled.
This time, I want to explore something similar to `constexpr` in C++.
In other words, add constructs to allow code to be executed during compile time.
I also want to experiment more with side effect free functions.

## How will it look?

This project is still very much in the prototype phase, therefore it's hard to say.
Whatever is in the resources directory in the tests is how it looks at the moment.

## How to build?

Use the gradle wrapper: `./gradlew test`, `./gradlew run`, ... (etc.)

Requires at least JDK 8 to be installed

(JDK 13 might be too new for gradle to handle at the moment though)

## What license?

MPL 2.0
