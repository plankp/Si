# Si [![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/plankp/Si.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/plankp/Si)

Don't worry! This project has nothing to do with actual Silicon...

## What is this?

This is a programming language. Name is a pun of C.

In the past, my projects were either purely translated, interpreted, or compiled.
This time, I want to explore something similar to `constexpr` in C++.
In other words, add constructs to allow code to be executed during compile time.
I also want to experiment more with side effect free functions.

## How will it look?

This project is still very much in the prototype phase, therefore it's hard to say.
Whatever is in the `spec/` directory is how it looks at the moment.

## How to build?

Use the gradle wrapper: `./gradlew test`, `./gradlew run`, ... (etc.)

Requires at least JDK 8 to be installed

## What license?

MPL 2.0
