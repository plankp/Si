# Si

Don't worry! This project has nothing to do with actual Silicon...

## What is this?

This is a programming language. Name is a pun of C.

In the past, my projects were either purely translated, interpreted, or compiled.
This time, I want to explore something similar to `constexpr` in C++.
In other words, add constructs to allow code to be executed during compile time.
I also want to experiment more with side effect free functions.

## How will it look?

No idea yet... More stuff will be added here though.

## How to build?

Use the gradle wrapper: `./gradlew test`, `./gradlew run`, ... (etc.)

Requires at least JDK 8 to be installed

(JDK 13 might be too new for gradle to handle at the moment though)

## What license?

MPL 2.0
